Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang's homepage
</h1>
    <p>I am an Economist.  I am a volunteer tutor of a Master's degree in Public Health programme.  The experience widens my knowledge to cover not only methodologies applied to social sciences, but those to medicine/health research.  I aim at deriving bottom-up policies from clinical decision-making perspectives.  I believe that developing a polycentric health system will enable patient-centred medicine/health care, and improve healthcare resource allocations. My research involves applications of mathematics, analytical and computational skills.  I self-taught myself various computational languages including R, python, SQL, bash, etc.  I also learn mechine learning and deep learning.  You may know more about me from <a href="../www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-tsang" class="uri" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am not an active user of github yet.  I don't have a plan to write a repo, but have uploaded some sample R snippets from my <a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">github profile</a>.  I will post more snippets written in various programming languages eventually.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will share various academic topics and some tricks for solving some common computational problems.
