Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang's homepage
</h1>
    <p>I am an Economist and a volunteer tutor of a Master's degree in Public Health programme.  The teaching experience drives me to learn evidence-based medicine research methodologies.  I find behaviours of clinical decision-making fascinating and critical to improving health system, but are not well covered by economics textbook.  I suggest developing polycentric health systems to enable patient-centred medicine/health care, and to improve healthcare resource allocations. My research involves applications of mathematics, analytical and computational skills.  I self-taught myself various computational languages including R, python, SQL, bash, etc.  The learning process introduces me to machine learning and deep learning.  You may know more about me from <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-tsang" class="uri" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My career focus is in analytics.  So, I don't have intention to write any repo, but have uploaded some sample R snippets to <a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">github</a>.  They show that I do use basic language to solve problems. I will post more snippets written in various programming languages eventually.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will share various academic topics and some tricks for solving some common computational problems.
