<h1 class="fontsize">Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang&#8217s homepage</h1>
    <p class="fontsize">I have been awarded a PhD in Empirical Economics, and have worked in academic institutes of several countries. I have been a tutor on a master&#8217s degree programme accredited by <a class="org" href="https://www.who.int/workforcealliance/members_partners/member_list/peoplesuni/en/" target="_blank">the EUCLID University</a> since 2012. I also work with <a class="org" href="https://nextgenu.org/" target="_blank">NextGenU.org</a> to revise public health courses delivered to graduates of medical schools.  The duties drive me to learn evidence-based medicine research methodologies applicable to clinical practice and health policy-making.
    <br>
    <br>
    Clinical reasoning is my primary <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandro_Tsang" target="_blank">research interest</a>.  I consider understanding clinical behaviours critical for deriving operationalisable healthcare policies, but this topic is scarcely covered in economics textbooks.  I derived a Mathematical model that captures the uncertainties involved in prescribing antibiotics and the consequences as a 3-month MSc dissertation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217590808002859" target="_blank">here</a> is a published version). I subsequently researched into other clinical decision problems, including eHealth, influenza-like illnesses, etc.  My <a href="https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/17576" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a> explored impacts of implementing eHealth to facilitate clinical reasoning from the perspectives of epistemology and practising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_medicine" target="_blank">humanistic medicine</a>.  I was keen on further developing this eHealth model.  My cold-call skill let me luckily reach <a href="https://www.uwl.ac.uk/about-us/how-university-works/biographies/professor-michael-loughlin" target="_blank">Professor Michael Loughlin</a> (I was not aware of his prominence in the philosophy of humanistic medicine and its related research).  My ideas intrigued him to guide me to further the research.  Without his guidance, I might not be motivated to write up an interdisciplinary theory that awarded me an <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSppvAr93tAhXNxoUKHVjFAM0QFjAAegQIAxAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pchealthcare.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fpchealthcare.org.uk%2Ffiles%2Fconference%2Fdownload%2Fespch_2nd_annual_brochure_spreads.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0YQ1F_7P3bqlo8PX1UTpPB" target="_blank">ESPCH Essay Prize</a> (reputed researchers were also in the competitor pool).  This theory portrays <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274729325_Are_economics_and_medicine_philosophically_incompatible_Arrow_physicians" target="_blank">Arrow Physician</a> to be an ideal medical practitioner in modern health systems.  S/he is required to deliver patient-centred care in a humanistic approach, and to reason like an economist at the same time. I postulate that establishing polycentric health systems is crucial to substantiate her/his mission, and to improve healthcare resource allocations through collective ethical actions.  My research also overlaps with policy-making for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sandro-tsang_certificate-from-global-health-elearning-ugcPost-6706292922452606976-23aN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infectious disease</a> surveillance and mitigating antimicrobial resistance. It also involves turning my self-taught skills in programming (e.g., R, python, SQL, bash, etc.), machine learning and deep learning into actions.
    <br>
    <br>
    I only apply programming skills to analytic levels.  However, I have spotted room for improving R packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/koRpus/news.html" target="_blank">koRpus</a>, <a href="http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/mice/NEWS" target="_blank">mice</a> and <a href="https://cran.rapporter.net/web/packages/miceadds/NEWS" target="_blank">miceadds</a>. I do practise the art of programming &#8211 solving problems efficiently with basic and minimal commands. This practice is shown in the codes for animating the colours of this webpage and my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">repos</a>.  This <a href="https://github.com/santsang/X-ray-Pytools" target="_blank">repo</a> contends python scripts written to build convolutional neural network of X-ray images.

    You may know more about me from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-tsang" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/skf_tsang" target="_blank">twitter</a>.  I will share various academic topics and some computation tricks soon.  A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jep.12348" target="_blank">contact</a> form will be set up shortly.
