Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang&#8217s homepage
</h1>
    <p>I have a PhD in Economics, and have worked in a number of universities. I have also been a tutor on the Public Health master&#8217s programme in the Peoples&#8217 Open Access Education Initiative since 2012. The teaching experience drives me to learn evidence-based medicine research methodologies.  Clinical reasoning is my primary research.  The behaviours are critical to improving health systems, but not well covered by economics textbooks.  I suggest developing polycentric health systems to facilitate delivering patient-centred care, and to improve healthcare resource allocations. The research often involves exploring various analytical algorithms.  I self-taught myself various computational languages including R, python, SQL, bash, etc.  Acquiring machine learning and deep learning methods was a natural consequence.  You may know more about me from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-tsang" class="uri" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/skf_tsang" class="uri" target="_blank">twitter</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Some snippets of R and python are available as GitHub <a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">repos</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/santsang/0f762987ea3c6b8bfe9e8f7459992b08" target="_blank">Gist</a> respectively. They show the art of programming - solving problems with basic commands. I will post more snippets eventually.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will share various academic topics and some computation tricks soon.  A <i>contact</i> form will be available shortly.
