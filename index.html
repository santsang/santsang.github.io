Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang's homepage
</h1>
    <p>My formal training was in Economics.  I believe understanding medical-decision making is crucial to developing bottom-up policies to improve health systems.  I believe that developing a polycentric health system will enable physicians to care for each patient as an individual and improve healthcare resource allocations. My research involves mathematical and statistical modelling.  In the process, I self-taught myself various programming languages such as R, python, SQL, bash, etc.  I also extend my analytical skills to cover mechine learning and deep learning.  You may know more about me from <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-tsang" target="_blank">LinkedIn.</a> 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am not an active user of github yet.  I don't have a plan to write a repo, but have uploaded some sample R snippets from my <a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">github profile</a>.  I will post more snippets written in various programming languages eventually.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will share various academic topics and some tricks for solving some common computational problems.
