Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang's homepage
</h1>
    <p>I am an Economist and a volunteer tutor of a Master's degree in Public Health programme.  The teaching experience drives me to learn evidence-based medicine research methodologies.  Clinical decision-making is my primary research focus.  The behaviours are critical to improving health sytems, but not well covered by economics textbooks.  I suggest developing polycentric health systems to enable patient-centred medicine/health care, and to improve healthcare resource allocations. My formal training covered mathematics and other quantitative skills.  I self-taught myself various computational languages including R, python, SQL, bash, etc.  The learning process introduces me to machine learning and deep learning.  You may know more about me from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-tsang" class="uri" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/skf_tsang" class="uri" target="_blank">twitter</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Some snippets of R and python are available as GitHub <a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">repos</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/santsang/0f762987ea3c6b8bfe9e8f7459992b08" target="_blank">Gist</a> respectively. They show the art of programming - solving problems with basic commands. I will post more snippets eventually.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will share various academic topics and some computation tricks soon.  A <i>contact</i> form will be available shortly.
