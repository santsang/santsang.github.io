Welcome to Dr. Sandro Tsang's homepage
</h1>
    <p>My formal training was in Economics.  I believe that physicians have a crucial role in allocating resources.  Understanding medical-decision making is crucial to developing bottom-up policies to improve health systems to care for patients better. I taught myself various programming languages.

    <p>I am not an active user of github yet.  You will find some sample R snippets from my 
<a href="https://github.com/santsang" target="_blank">github profile</a>.

    <p>I will post various academic matters here soon.  I would share some tricks to solve some common computational problems easily.  I will also post more snippets written in various programming languages soon.
